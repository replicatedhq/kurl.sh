# Contributing

Deploying to staging happens automatically when merging to the `main` branch.

Use the `release` branch to deploy to production. Create a pull request to the `release` branch. After it is approved and merged, the changes are deployed to production. **Note:** Pull requests to the `release` branch should come from the `main` branch.
