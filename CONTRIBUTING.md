# Contributing

Deploying to staging happens automatically when merging to the `master` branch.

Deploying to production happens through the `release` branch. Create a pull request to that branch and once it's approved and merged, the changes will be deployed to production. Note: pull requests to the `release` branch should come from the `master` branch.
