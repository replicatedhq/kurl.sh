## kurl.sh Installer Creation
[kurl.sh](https://kurl.sh) hosts a UI for configuring your Kubernetes distro and creating both an kURL URL and a kURL airgap package.

For each component you'll need to decide if you want to include the latest version, a specific tagged version or exclude the add-on all together.

As you make your selections the declarative YAML for the kURL manifest is dynamically built & displayed for you. Simultaneously, the install URL will change to a hash of the installation.

## Advanced Options
The kURL manifest can include [advanced configuration](add-on-adv-options) options for each add-on.
