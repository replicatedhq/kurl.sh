- Fixed an issue that would cause an upgrade of Prometheus from version 0.44.1 to any later version to cause the Contour Pods to crash.
- Fixed an issue in earlier versions of the Prometheus add-on which prevented the Grafana Dashboard from connecting to the Prometheus data store.
- Fixed an issue that could cause a kURL upgrade to fail if new add-ons had been added to kURL (even if they were not used in that installer).
