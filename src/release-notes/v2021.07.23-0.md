### <span class="label label-green">New Features</span>
- Host preflight results are now tracked in the directory `/var/lib/kurl/host-preflights`.

### <span class="label label-blue">Improvements</span>
- Host preflights can now be run with an installer spec from STDIN, for example `kubectl get installer 6abe39c -oyaml | /var/lib/kurl/bin/kurl host preflight -`.
- Host preflight added to check disk usage in /var/lib/docker.

### <span class="label label-orange">Bug Fixes</span>

- Fixed issue where warning messages would be displayed for passing preflight checks.
- Fixed issue where terminal control characters were erroneously displayed in noninteractive preflight check output. 
- Fixed an issue where invalid configurations for Rook version 1.4 or greater would pass validation checks.
