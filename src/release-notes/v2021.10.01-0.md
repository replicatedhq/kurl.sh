### <span class="label label-green">New Features</span>
- containerd is now the default container runtime, replacing the previous default container runtime, Docker.
- log rotation will now be configured by default for the [docker addon](https://kurl.sh/docs/add-ons/docker), where the [max-size](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/json-file/#options) parameter for the log file is set to `10m`.
- added the ability to configure log rotation through kubelet, which helps when using containerd instead of docker.
### <span class="label label-blue">Improvements</span>
- When Longhorn is specified in an installer spec but an object store (e.g., MinIO) is not, the [Registry add-on](/docs/add-ons/registry) will be deployed with two replicas and a ReadWriteMany (RWX) volume for greater availability.
### <span class="label label-orange">Bug Fixes</span>
- Fixed a bug that didn't allow User and Service Account tokens to authenticate to the kURL API.
