### <span class="label label-blue">Improvements</span>
- The default configuration for https://kurl.sh/latest was updated to include Kubernetes 1.21 instead of 1.19, and Rook was replaced with Longhorn and MinIO. Note that using `rook: latest` with `kubernetes: latest` no longer works as Rook 1.0.4 is not compatible with Kubernetes 1.20+. To avoid this, pin a specific version instead of using `latest`.
