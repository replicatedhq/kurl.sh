### <span class="label label-green">New Features</span>
- [Host preflights](https://kurl.sh/docs/create-installer/host-preflights/) are now blocking. Failures will cause the installer to exit with error. Warnings will still result in the installer continuing. `host-preflight-ignore` and `host-preflight-enforce-warnings` are available to change the default behavior.

### <span class="label label-blue">Improvements</span>
- Adds [KOTS add-on](/docs/add-ons/kotsadm) version v1.60.0.
- Adds [EKCO add-on](/docs/add-ons/ekco) version v0.16.0 which does a rollout restart of the envoy pods after generating the new certificates instead of restarting all pods at once. It will also validate and renew certificates on startup.

### <span class="label label-orange">Bug Fixes</span>
- Fix legacy `apiregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1` resource for Prometheus 0.53.1-30.1.0.
