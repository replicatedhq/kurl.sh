### <span class="label label-green">New Features</span>
- [Host preflight](https://kurl.sh/docs/install-with-kurl/host-preflights/) failures are now blocking, and the installer will exit with error. Warnings do not cause the installer to exit. Warnings can be enforced and errors can be ignored with `host-preflight-enforce-warnings` and `host-preflight-ignore`.

### <span class="label label-blue">Improvements</span>
- Adds [KOTS add-on](/docs/add-ons/kotsadm) version v1.60.0.
- Adds [EKCO add-on](/docs/add-ons/ekco) version 0.16.0, which does a rollout restart of the envoy pods after generating the new certificates instead of restarting all pods at once. It will also validate and renew certificates on startup.

### <span class="label label-orange">Bug Fixes</span>
- Fix legacy `apiregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1` resource for Prometheus 0.53.1-30.1.0.
