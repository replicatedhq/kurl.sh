### <span class="label label-green">New Features</span>
- Added the ability to configure the Kubernetes service type used by the [Prometheus add-on](/docs/add-ons/prometheus) to expose Prometheus, Grafana and Alertmanager. The currently accepted options are "NodePort" as the default, and "ClusterIP".
- [Migrations](/docs/install-with-kurl/migrating) are a supported way to change CSI, CRI, and CNI providers.

### <span class="label label-orange">Bug Fixes</span>
- Fixed an issue that would cause Kubernetes upgrades to fail when the hostname of a node contains uppercase characters.
- Fixed an issue that prevented containerd from trusting the registry certificate except on the first primary.
